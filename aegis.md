# Aegis agent configuration

Aegis Agent is a secure vault & agent on agnostic base Gnu POSIX systems.
It is meant to be unixversal or nigh universal, working on windows cygwin. 
Unlike Keepass, KeepassX, or CyberArk it does not rely on a UI interface.
It relies on base tools: a pass password-store, gnupg, git, openssh, aws.
